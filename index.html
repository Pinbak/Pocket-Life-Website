        <h2 align="center">About</h2>
        <p align="center">I'm a university student working on a game called Pocket Life. I have documented my progress on my blog. Pocket Life is set in a town, where the player is born and will eventually die. The town is lived in by peeps. These peeps have autonomy, which leads them to pursue their own lives. Along with the player, they will get married, have children, get promoted in their careers and cause all sorts of drama.</p>
